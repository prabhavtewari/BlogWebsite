        Gyms and fitness centers around the world are closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Trying to stay motivated to achieve your fitness goals can seem like a 
        tough job at this time. Having a pantry stocked with tasty food that seems irresistible makes it even harder to keep a track of your diet.You may be 
        surrounded by friends or family that might not support your goals or agree with your fitness regime. Owning a home gym at this time is a huge boon, but 
        that isn't the case with most of us. Buying equipment is also out of the picture as e-commerce giants have restricted their catalogues to essential products.
     <br>
          Here are some tips to help you maintain your gains or at the very least reduce the damage done to  them.
    
    </p>

    <h2>Calisthenics</h2> 

    <p class="p1">
        Calisthenics is a form of exercise consisting of a variety of movements that exercise large muscle groups, such as running, standing, grasping, pushing, etc. 
        These exercises are often performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment, as bodyweight exercises.
    </p>
    
    <p class="p1">
        If you consider yourself a beginner or even intermediate then you can easily maintain and gain muscle with bodywieght exercises.The key like always is
        volume and variety.Push ups, squats and sit ups are the exercises that most think of when trying to train without equiment but there are many variations 
        and types of exercises you can perform to optimise muscle growth. If standard pushups are too hard, try knee pushups. If they are too easy try 
        decline or explosive pushups.
        <br><br> If you have to perform too many squats to reach failure try pistol squats. They may be hard to perform right off the the bat
        so follow the progressions to do them well. Beginners usually spend too much time training abs. If your goal is getting a six pack, it would make more 
        sense to reduce your body fat level first.
        <br><br>
        It is important to set realisitic goals. Don't jumo right in and try to do 200 push ups a day, like everything, moderation is key.

    <h2>Using Household Items to Train</h2>

    <p>
        It would be a bad idea to use a broom or mop as a barbell or using plastic chairs as inclined benches, but if you choose wisely, objects around you can be
        used as weights to have a better training session. You can fill a bag with heavy books and put it on to make your leg exercises more challenging.
        You can easily perform biceps curls with the bag. Hang on to the ledge of a loft to do pull ups and hanging leg raises, perform chest dips on the corner of
        the kitchen counter. Stuff a few newspapers under a door and put a towel on top of it to do pullups if the lofts aren't sturdy.

<h2>Intensity</h2>

 <p>
Gym or no gym, may people lack intensity in their workouts. 3 sets of 12 is what is thrown around whenever you ask about the number of reps and sets 
while sets of 8-12 are optimal for muscle hypertrophy (growth) it has to be at an adequate weight. When you workout you should Use 50-75% of your 
one-repetition maximum (1RM) for 3-6 sets of 8-20 repetitions.
<br><br>
Put simply, you have to be putting in max effort by your last rep, be it the first or last 
set of your workout. To accurately describe this imagine the effort you would put in to lift a weight if someone were to put a gun to your head or 
offered you 5 crore Rupees, that's how you should feel while performing the last few reps of your set. You don't have much control over the weight in
 this situation so you should perform the maximum amount of reps you can if you want to really gain muscle. Try to push yourself to failure on every set. If your goal is to just lose fat you don't
 need the same intensity.
</p>
    

<h2>Cardio</h2>

<p class="p2">Cardio is an extremely effictive way to increase calorie expenditure. It improves
     cardiovascular health and can help boost your mood. Yes, it really does. Your brain releases 
     endorphines (hormones that make you feel good) when you do cardio.
     
     <br><br>Going out for a run or
      walk isn't an option  but if you live in an apartment you can easily use the stairs. Going up and down the stairs at a 
moderate pace for 35-60 minutes 3-4 times a week is what you should aim for. If you want to make it harder you can put on the backpack filled with books.
<br><br>
High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is also an option. As the name suggests you do exercises like high knees,Jumping jacks and burpees at your
 best pace and then take a small break and repeat. If done properly, it can be effective. Dancing along to videos can also be considered.

<h2>Diet</h2>
 
<p>Fitness is 80% diet and 20% exercise. It doesn't matter if you run for an hour a day only to go home and snack on namkeen and fried food.Calories in; 
    Calories out are the basic rule you should follow. Being locked in your house means your energy expenditure is probably lower than it usually is as you
     are less active through the day. To compensate for this try to reduce your portions of carbohydrates and fats a bit. <br><br>It is hard to stay focused on your
     diet if you have snacks lying around the house. The best way to deal with this is to keep them out of sight to avoid getting tempted. Even elite 
    athletes would want to eat junk is they saw them lying around their house. Stock up on low calorie foods with lots of fiber to fill you up just in
     case you get hungry. Some foods like meats might not be available at this time, eggs are easily available in most areas though. Egg whites are extremely 
    satiating and high in protein, so eat them regularly. The yolks are a good source of healthy fats and contain protein too.

<h2>Sleep and Stress</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px;">These are the most underrated factors.

Cortisol is the stress hormone and it reduces muscle growth, increases fat cell production and muscle loss. <br><br>When you sleep less, your body starts to burn 
calories at a slower rate to preserve energy. In the study, people burned on average 400 more calories by sleeping for three more hoursâ€”that's an additional
 2,800 calories burned in just one week. With less sleep, the body seeks to meet the increased metabolic needs of longer working hours by shifting into a 
lower gear, so to speak, that burn  s fewer calories and less fat. While most see this as an opportunity to binge a tv show throughout the night, you would be
 better off getting your sleep schedule right. <a  class="linelink" href="sleep.html">Find out more about the benifits of sleep.</a>
