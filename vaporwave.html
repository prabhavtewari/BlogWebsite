  Vaporwave is the music of 'non-times' and 'non-places' because it is skeptical of what 
  consumer culture has done to time and space".

<p class="ayy">Of all the micro-genres to spawn out of 2000s chillwave, vaporwave aesthetic has had the most lasting impact. Drawing almost entirely from the music and culture of the 1980s and 1990s, it has a self-aware and nostalgic quality. Sampling sources as diverse as muzak, elevator music, lounge jazz, City Pop, 1980s synth-pop, R&B and even songs from corporate training videos, it has a synthetic and ambiguous vibe that has somehow endured on the internet since its introduction in 2011.

<p class="ayy">It started its career online, mysterious artists digitally releasing music, free for anyone to download. Music itself was inspired by 80’s and 90’s smooth jazz, lounge and elevator music, chapped and screwed, usually with samples. Aside from the music, ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ  play a great role in true perception of vaporwave. In both aspects we see bringing flashes of popular entertainment from 80s and 90s back to life, visualized with early internet web designs, rendered 3D objects and pastel neon colors. Japanese pop culture from that era also had a great influence.

</p> <p class="ayy"> Behind the soft electronic, synthy sound and glitchy visuals, irony and critique of modern society appears (as you might guess, vaporwave became quite popular on reddit and 4chan). When you look at it, it’s nothing new, rebelling against society through music, previous generations have done it too; but what is interesting and different is the way that it’s done – subtly, behind the scenes. Spontaneous emergence, immaterial attitude mixed with nostalgia and memes made it viral in relatively short time.</p>

<h2>Sub-genres of Vaporwave</h2>
<p class="ayy">Even within the micro-genre of Vaporwave, there are spin-offs. One is Simpsonwave, which pairs music from the genre with washed-out VHS-like footage from The Simpsons, often in the form of hallucinatory gifs or short videos. Other darker spin-offs are Fashwave, which combines Nazi and fascist symbols with vaporware aesthetics, and the self-explanatory Trumpwave, which makes sense considering Trump was considered the ultimate symbol of the money excess of the 1980s.</p>

<p class="ayy">It doesn't matter wether you are into it because you are skeptical of what consumer culture has done to time and space or because it looks cool, it is a pretty neat style of art that you can enjoy in your downtime. It also makes for some really interesting wallpapers.</p>
